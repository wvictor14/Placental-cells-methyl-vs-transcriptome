Two sources for scRNAseq data:

Shannon 2022: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35020896/
Vento-tormo 2018

I have the vento-tormo data already downloaded and processed from other projects.

In this script, I download Shannon 2022 data from GEO and save as a seurat / matrix for downstream analyses.

# download from GEO

The series matrix file from GEO is incomplete. Instead I download the matrix/features/barcodes data from _RAW.tar 

```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(here)
```

```{r}
GSM5315569_P277 <- Read10X(data.dir = here::here('data', 'GSE174481_RAW', 'GSM5315569_P277'))
GSM5315569_P277
```
